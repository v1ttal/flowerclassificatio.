# flowerclassification.
This project involves developing an AI-powered flower classification system that uses machine learning techniques to accurately identify and categorize various types of flowers. The system leverages a deep learning model, trained on a diverse dataset of flower images, to recognize and classify different species based on their unique characteristics. The project aims to provide a robust solution for botanists, garden enthusiasts, and researchers to automate the process of flower identification, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. The final model will be deployed as a web or mobile application, allowing users to upload images and receive instant flower classification results..
